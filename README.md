So what are Web Workers?
Web Workers are Javascript scripts executed from an HTML page that runs on a background thread away from the main execution thread. Data is sent between the main thread and workers through messages. Since these workers run on a separate thread than the main execution thread, you can utilize web workers to run process intensive tasks from the browser without creating blocking instances.
